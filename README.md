# Meetup Dapp (WIP)

A simple frontend React application to interact with this [Smart Contract](https://github.com/robertcasanova/meetup-smart-contract)

*This is just a PoC, the code is not tested yet and lot of things must be improved*

## Install deps

`npm i`

## Setup

Rename `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and set the `REACT_APP_MEETUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` address to the smart contract address of Meetup (es: [0x816d702F44d7A0cbd0B2b362b3C8724b9328203f](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x816d702F44d7A0cbd0B2b362b3C8724b9328203f)).
